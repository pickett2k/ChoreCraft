# ChoreCraft - Implementation Log

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a household chore management app with gamification, rewards system, and premium features.

## 🎨 Design System & Styling Guidelines

### Modern UI/UX Principles
- **Sweepy-inspired design**: Clean, modern, engaging interface
- **Card-based layout**: White cards on light gray backgrounds with shadows
- **Consistent spacing**: 15-20px margins, 20px padding for cards
- **Rounded corners**: 16-20px border radius for modern feel
- **Elevation & shadows**: Subtle shadows for depth and hierarchy

### Color Palette
```typescript
const colors = {
  // Primary colors
  primary: '#6C63FF',           // Main purple (headers, primary actions)
  background: '#F8FAFC',        // Light gray background
  cardBackground: '#FFFFFF',    // White cards
  
  // Accent colors
  gold: '#FFD700',             // Coins/achievements
  green: '#4CAF50',            // Money/balance
  pink: '#EC4899',             // Secondary actions
  emerald: '#10B981',          // Success/create actions
  amber: '#F59E0B',            // Warning/join actions
  
  // Text colors
  textPrimary: '#1F2937',      // Main text
  textSecondary: '#6B7280',    // Secondary text
  textLight: '#9CA3AF',        // Light text
  
  // Status colors
  admin: '#DC2626',            // Admin badge
  user: '#3B82F6',             // User badge
  premium: '#7C3AED',          // Premium badge
  free: '#6B7280',             // Free badge
};
```

### Typography
```typescript
const typography = {
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: colors.textPrimary,
  },
  sectionTitle: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',

    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: 'white',
  },
  body: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: colors.textPrimary,
  },
  caption: {
    fontSize: 14,
    color: colors.textSecondary,
  },

- **Size guidelines**: 20px (small), 24px (medium), 28px (large), 32px (XL)

## 🔥 Firebase Integration Roadmap

### Current Status: MOCK DATA PHASE
The app currently uses mock data for development and UI testing. All Firebase integration points are clearly marked with TODO comments.

### Firebase Integration Points

#### 1. Chores Management (`app/(tabs)/two.tsx`)
```typescript
// CURRENT: Mock data
const mockChores = [...];

// TODO: Replace with Firebase hooks
// const { chores, loading, error } = useChores(user?.householdId);
// const { createChore } = useChoreActions();
// const { completeChore, verifyChore } = useChoreActions();
```

#### 2. Required Firebase Services
- **`useChores(householdId)`**: Real-time chore fetching
- **`useChoreActions()`**: Create, complete, verify chores
- **Error handling**: Loading states and error boundaries
- **Offline sync**: Queue actions when offline

#### 3. Data Structure Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced chore object for Firebase
interface Chore {
  id: string;
  householdId: string;        // Link to household
  title: string;
  description: string;
  assignedTo: string[];       // User IDs
  createdBy: string;          // User ID
  rewardValue: number;
  rewardType: 'coins' | 'gbp';
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'verified';
  dueDate: Timestamp;
  frequency: 'once' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
  completedBy?: string;       // User ID
  completedAt?: Timestamp;
  verifiedBy?: string;        // User ID (admin)
  verifiedAt?: Timestamp;
  beforePhoto?: string;       // Storage URL
  afterPhoto?: string;        // Storage URL
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

#### 4. UI States to Implement
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens while fetching
- **Error handling**: Retry buttons and error messages
- **Empty states**: Improved empty states with actions
- **Real-time updates**: Live updates when chores change
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate UI feedback

#### 5. Future Screens to Connect
- **Create Chore Screen**: Form for admins to create chores
- **Chore Detail Screen**: View/edit individual chores
- **User Profile**: Real user data and settings
- **Household Management**: Create/join households

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **🚨 Expo Go Limitations - READ FIRST**

**IMPORTANT: Firebase services have different compatibility with Expo Go:**

#### ✅ **Works in Expo Go:**
- **Firestore Database** - Full functionality
- **Cloud Storage** - Full functionality  
- **Cloud Functions** - Full functionality
- **Basic app functionality** - Navigation, UI, business logic

#### ❌ **Does NOT Work in Expo Go (Requires Native Build):**
- **Firebase Authentication** - Uses native modules
- **Push Notifications** - Uses native modules
- **App Check** - Uses native modules
- **Analytics** - Uses native modules

#### **🔄 Development Workflow:**

1. **Expo Go Phase (Current)**:
   - Test all UI components and navigation
   - Test database operations (Firestore)
   - Test file storage operations
   - Auth system automatically falls back to mock mode
   - **Mock users get consistent user IDs** based on email (user-normalized-email)
   - **Mock users are automatically created in Firestore** for database testing
   - Don't waste time debugging Firebase Auth - it's expected to fail

2. **Development Build Phase**:
   - Build with `expo build` or EAS Build
   - Test real Firebase Authentication
   - Test push notifications
   - Test native-dependent features

3. **Production Build Phase**:
   - Final testing with all features
   - App Store/Play Store deployment

**Remember: The auth fallback system is intentional - not a bug!**

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Implemented 3-tier fallback system
- **Reason**: Expo Go limitations require graceful handling of Firebase Auth failures
- **Result**: App works in all environments (Expo Go, development build, production)

### State Management
- **Decision**: React Context API instead of Redux
- **Reason**: Simpler setup for current app complexity
- **Future**: May migrate to Zustand or Redux Toolkit if state becomes complex

### Database Strategy
- **Decision**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data
- **Reason**: Real-time updates, offline support, scalability
- **Implementation**: Mock data system during development phase

### UI Framework
- **Decision**: Custom React Native components
- **Reason**: Full control over design and performance
- **Libraries**: React Native Paper for some components

## Lessons Learned

### Firebase in Expo Go
- Firebase Auth requires native modules - doesn't work in Expo Go
- Firestore and Storage work perfectly in Expo Go
- Always implement fallback systems for native-dependent features
- Mock data systems are essential for Expo Go development

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation is crucial for hybrid development
- Comprehensive logging helps debug complex initialization issues
- User experience should never suffer due to backend failures

### Development Workflow
- Test UI and business logic in Expo Go first
- Use development builds for native feature testing
- Keep production builds for final validation

## Next Steps
