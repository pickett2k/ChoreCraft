## 3. ‚öñÔ∏è Implementation Plan (AI Agent-Friendly)

### Phase 1: Core Setup

1. Set up Expo project with navigation and basic screen structure
2. Integrate Firebase Auth with email login
3. Enable household creation + joining with invite code
4. Set user role (Parent/Child) on registration

### Phase 2: Chore Engine MVP

1. Create chore schema (task name, frequency, assigned to, reward value, before photo, etc.)
2. Build chore creation form (Parent only)
3. Build chore list view (Today, Upcoming, Completed)
4. Enable chore completion with after photo upload

### Phase 3: Rewards Engine

1. Add reward type selector (coins or GBP) at household level
2. Add coin-to-reward conversion chart (editable by Parent)
3. Show user reward balance (total coins/GBP)
4. Add reward issuance flow: Parent approves + marks as paid
5. Log reward history

### Phase 4: Notifications

1. Register for Expo push notifications per user
2. Send push notification on:

   * Task assignment
   * Task due reminder
   * Task completed
   * Reward issued

### Phase 5: Offline Sync & Polish

1. Store key chore and reward data in AsyncStorage
2. Add local caching and sync logic with backend
3. UI improvements and onboarding polish

### Phase 6: Optional Extensions

* Stripe or In-App Purchases for Premium Tier

  * Basic Free Tier: limited members, no image uploads, no reward tracking
  * Premium: all features unlocked
  * Manual premium flag override using Firebase Console (`isPremium=true` per user or household)
* Admin dashboard for oversight
* Gamification features (badges, streaks)

## 4. üí∏ Monetization Strategy Options

### Option A: Freemium Model (Recommended)

* **Free Tier**:

  * 1 household
  * 3 members max
  * Limited tasks/week
  * No photo uploads or reward tracking

* **Premium Tier** (via Stripe or IAP):

  * Unlimited households and members
  * Photo support (before/after)
  * Full reward and payment tracking
  * Notifications and history logs

* **Developer Bypass**:

  * Set `isPremium=true` manually in Firebase Console for specific user or household
  * Optional local override for developer testing

### Option B: One-Time Purchase

* Charge **¬£9.99** on app stores
* No free tier
* Pros: No IAP headaches, no ongoing infra logic
* Cons: No trial experience, less discoverability, no recurring revenue
