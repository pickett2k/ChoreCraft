## Support

For any email delivery issues:

2. Verify API key configuration

4. Contact Resend support if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Tags should only contain ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes"
- **Fix**: Household names are automatically sanitized to replace special characters with underscores
- **Example**: "Smith Family üè†" becomes "Smith_Family__"

#### "Invalid from address"
- **Fix**: Ensure the domain is verified in Resend dashboard
- **Current**: `ChoreCraft <noreply@formcraft.co.uk>`

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Fix**: Resend free tier allows 3,000 emails/month
- **Solution**: Upgrade plan or implement email queuing

#### Email not delivered
- **Check**: Resend dashboard for bounce/complaint status
- **Common causes**: Invalid recipient email, spam filters, domain reputation
